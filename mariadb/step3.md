# Run the installation

Now that your server is ready to install MariaDB, you can do this by using the `yum install` command.

Simply run:

`yum install -y MariaDB-server`{{execute}}

After a few minutes you will have the MariaDB Database Server installed to your instance.

As the command runs, you will note it installs all the dependencies that are required.
