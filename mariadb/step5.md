# Securing MariaDB

After you have installed MariaDB, you should run a simple script to help secure the installation.

It is recommended that you do this everytime you install MariaDB to a server.

`mariadb-secure-installation`{{execute}}

When you run this command, you will not have a root password set, so when requested to enter the current password just press `enter`. You can answer 'Y' to every question, apart from when you are asked to set a password. Please enter a secure password._
