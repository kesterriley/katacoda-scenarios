# Preparing your environment


It is important to make sure that the environment is up to date, Operating Systems are updated often. It is good practice to ensure all patches and updates are applied.

In this environment we are going to use `yum` to update our environments.

Run the update command on your environment now:

`yum update -y`{{execute}}


Please be patient and make sure this has finished running before continuing, as this can take some time to run._
